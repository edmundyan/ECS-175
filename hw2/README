For this assignemtn, I created the basic 3-branching factor tree.  It would
recurse straight up, and also along a left and right branch.  Some interesting
features were:

Randomization:
Both the angle of each recursion and the length of each level were randomized
to create a more "realistic" looking tree.

Bezier Curved Leaves:
Instead of hardcoding in vertices for each leaf, I generated the leaves
dynamicaly using a quadratic bezier curve.  I used two rectangles next to
each other to create two half-circles to create the leaf.

Background:
There are two background objects here.  The first, the Sun, is similar to how
the leaf was made.  Two rectangles next to each other (that form a square), 
and two half circles that put them together.  Lastly, the "floor", as I have
named it was used doing a cubic Bezier curve to make the S-like shape.
